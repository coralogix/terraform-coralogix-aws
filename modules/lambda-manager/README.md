## Requirements

### Firehose
We are assuming you deployed our Firehose integration per our integration https://coralogix.com/docs/aws-firehose/

Firehose Destination requires a Role to allow Cloudwatch to send logs to Firehose. For that please verify that the role you are using in DESTINATION_ROLO has the following definitions.

Make sure that you put it the **Resource** field the arn for the destination firehose

Make sure that you have replaced the **Resource** to the arn of the lambda, and the account_id with your account id in the **ArnLike**

```
{
 "Sid": "allow-logs-to-trigger",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
      "Resource": <arn for the destination lambda>,
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:<account_id>:log-group:*:*"
