# Contributing Guide

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! ðŸ’–

If you'd like to report a bug or suggest a feature or get in touch with the repository owners for any other reason, the best way to do this is by opening an issue on the repository.

In case of a bug report, please be precise in your description, and include all the relevant information, such as the integration that you are trying to deploy, the version of the integration that you are using ...

If you'd like to contribute to our code or documentation, the best way to go about this is to first open an issue (if you have e.g. a new feature you'd like to contribute) and discuss with the repository owners, before submitting the change itself.
